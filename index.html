              Have you ever found yourself to be in a bind over your form during sports? Your basketball throw is always a bit off, swing the bat always off kilter, or even arrows flying off to Narnia.
              Well, you are in luck. Our product idea intends to fix exactly that. The Limb Movement Tracker (not the actual name) is a series of wristbands that can connect to your phone or computer and tell you where your limbs are during your sporting attempts.
              Better yet, within the preset sport(s), it can tell you what you are doing wrong. Too fast of a rise, too slow of a release, or even the curse of gravity. So now you know exactly what is going on, and you can see it on your screen to how to fix that problem.

            <h3>Difficulties</h3>
            <p>I had a lot of trouble in hosting the website through docker and onto digital ocean. Instead I did a somewhat weird workaround with static app websites. The server runs completely as an app based website, so it can be updated directly from a github repository, instead of through docker. Databases are not yet implemented but can also be used as long as the proper codes are introduced.</p>

          <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>For style, I chose to have a simple banner image and resulting text in a background image. The banner image is done through hero-image and also have stylized text to accompany it. It's possible to buttons and dropdown menus, but I have yet to decide if I need them.</p>

          <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Text</h3>
            <p>I chose Times New Roman as my default text style and the headings have unique shadowing and font size!</p>

            <h3>Font Format:</h3>
            <p>Previously the font format was too small and cluttered in order to fit the background lined paper. So I enlarged the font size and restrained to two fonts: Times New Roman and Cmabria</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Layout:</h3>
            <p>The lined paper background was hard to read and it had a tendency to resize poorly with varying windows. So I redesigned the site completely out of flex boxes and threw out background images for each textbox. I replaced it with a solid biege color.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Others:</h3>
            <p>Instead of a random button somewhere on the page to link to another page, I made a proper navigation bar up at the top of the website. I also implemented some animations for each text-container!</p>
