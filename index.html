  <h2>Project Idea:</h2>
    <h3>Limb Movement Tracker</h3>
  <p>
    Have you ever found yourself to be in a bind over your form during sports? Your basketball throw is always a bit off, swing the bat always off kilter, or even arrows flying off to Narnia.
    Well, you are in luck. Our product idea intends to fix exactly that. The Limb Movement Tracker (not the actual name) is a series of wristbands that can connect to your phone or computer and tell you where your limbs are during your sporting attempts.
    Better yet, within the preset sport(s), it can tell you what you are doing wrong. Too fast of a rise, too slow of a release, or even the curse of gravity. So now you know exactly what is going on, and you can see it on your screen to how to fix that problem.

  <h2>Website Style Choices:</h2>
  <p>
    I had a lot of trouble in hosting the website through docker and onto digital ocean. Instead I did a somewhat weird workaround with static app websites. The server runs completely as an app based website, so it can be updated directly from a github repository, instead of through docker. Databases are not yet implemented but can also be used as long as the proper codes are introduced.
  </p>
  <p>For style, I chose to have a simple banner image and resulting text in a background image. The banner image is done through hero-image and also have stylized text to accompany it. It's possible to buttons and dropdown menus, but I have yet to decide if I need them.</p>
  <p>My background images are repeating lined paper and intentionally have text written on it seemingly randomly, though I might change it in the future if it gets hard to read</p>
  <p>I also stylized the text with a standardized font instead of a default font</p>
