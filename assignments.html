                    UI designs across different web browsers are now almost all uniform. They all have a search bar, tool bar, tabs bar, bookmark, and interface with a search engine. Users will have almost always the same experience across different browsers, nothing would be too unfamiliar or drastically different from the fundamentals.

                    Drop down tabs when browsing news groups design by type. Users will not find Global News under Entertainment section, so this way Users can find needed materials at a glance. No need to browse the entire newspaper or website to find a single column. Just look by topic.

                    Although Amazon boasts of enabling Users to order through Alexa and automated orders, they still use confirmation pages during checkout. This is a necessary step and cannot be avoided because Users have to enter necessary information like credit card, delivery address, and item amount before actually ordering. This step allows users to confirm purchase and give liability if Users buy something they did not intend.

                <h4>Basic Information</h4>
                <p>
                    On first interaction with the product (RePlai), the user needs to know what are the necessary devices to get the product up and running. The necessary devices and knowledge include batteries, a computer or phone, WiFi coverage, and knowledge of social media. Users need to understand this product is not designed to give user responses on how to improve sports performance, it is a semi-social product that will inform users how well they mimicked a series of actions. RePlai also comes with a series of sensors to attach to a user’s body, so users must know how to attach them to key areas of movement with provided velcro and possibly straps for further security.

                <h4>IA Design Principles</h4>
                <p>
                    Principle of Disclosure, Principle of Exemplars, and Principle of Focused Navigation are the most important design principles for RePlai. The core of our product is a social media and sports app hybrid. So we take the design principles already used in both markets into our app like activity timers, motion tracking, friends and social interactions, etc. RePlai relies on numerous incoming data points from body sensors, much of the information is masked as a 3D display but we can display all the raw sensor data if the user desires. In our application, we sectioned the display into three general tab categories: Home, Record, and Profile. This clear division between tabs allows users to focus on what they want to use and see at that moment in time. The flow does not interrupt user navigation to other parts of the app because the intention is to have clear divides on what the user should be focused on.            </div>

                <p>
                    RePlai makes the most sense with a mixture of Sequential and Chronological logical principles. Our application has a lengthy procedure at set up and requires users to jump through a few hoops to get to their desired outcome. It will walk through users the complexity and simple navigation of displays inherent to some social media platforms. It should also be organized chronologically because we are recording small “videos” and recommending “templates” at the same time. RePlai will thrive in a situation where it refreshes based on the most recent and popular “templates”.
