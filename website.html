            <h3>Difficulties</h3>
            <p>I had a lot of trouble in hosting the website through docker and onto digital ocean. Instead I did a somewhat weird workaround with static app websites. The server runs completely as an app based website, so it can be updated directly from a github repository, instead of through docker. Databases are not yet implemented but can also be used as long as the proper codes are introduced.</p>

          <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>For style, I chose to have a simple banner image and resulting text in a background image. The banner image is done through hero-image and also have stylized text to accompany it. It's possible to buttons and dropdown menus, but I have yet to decide if I need them.</p>

            <h3>Text</h3>
            <p>I chose Times New Roman as my default text style and the headings have unique shadowing and font size!</p>

            <h3>Font Format:</h3>
            <p>Previously the font format was too small and cluttered in order to fit the background lined paper. So I enlarged the font size and restrained to two fonts: Times New Roman and Cmabria</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Layout:</h3>
            <p>The lined paper background was hard to read and it had a tendency to resize poorly with varying windows. So I redesigned the site completely out of flex boxes and threw out background images for each textbox. I replaced it with a solid biege color.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-box">
            <h3>Others:</h3>
            <p>Instead of a random button somewhere on the page to link to another page, I made a proper navigation bar up at the top of the website. I also implemented some animations for each text-container!</p>

            <p>Total improvements touched on User Visibility (animations and background), unified Consistency (uniform flexboxes), and limited User Viscosity (understandable buttons and navbar)</p>
