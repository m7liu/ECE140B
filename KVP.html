    <h2>Our Product: (Name is still pending XD)</h2>
    <p>
      Our product is the simple and cheap solution to capture the motion of your limbs. If you have ever wanted to record yourself playing basketball, archery, and any sport, you know it's an impossible task without someone or something holding a camera. So there are very few choices to correct your form except to relive the experience and doing it again, and again, and again. 
      Our product is here to fix this. If you can't hold the camera yourself then let some other device record you. We use a simple combination of lightweight hardware strapped onto key areas of your limbs to record your movement. So when you draw back the string, coil up for a jump, or pass the ball, you will know exactly what you did and how you did it via our product.
      It will record your movement with the lightweight devices, display it on a screen, so you can watch improvement over time and fix mistakes with tangible feedback.
