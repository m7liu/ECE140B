            Our product is the simple and cheap solution to capture the motion of your limbs. If you have ever wanted to record yourself playing basketball, archery, and any sport, you know it's an impossible task without someone or something holding a camera. So there are very few choices to correct your form except to relive the experience and doing it again, and again, and again. 
            Our product is here to fix this. If you can't hold the camera yourself then let some other device record you. We use a simple combination of lightweight hardware strapped onto key areas of your limbs to record your movement. So when you draw back the string, coil up for a jump, or pass the ball, you will know exactly what you did and how you did it via our product.
            It will record your movement with the lightweight devices, display it on a screen, so you can watch improvement over time and fix mistakes with tangible feedback.

                <p>	Our MVP design stresses the ease of visual interpretation of data and simple app navigation as our useability-driven design. The visual interpretation is achieved through a series of overlay-able skeleton gifs that can compare visual performance from one instance/attempt to another. It would look like several skeletons moving together at the same time and a sidebar that can selectively choose which skeleton to show at the same moment. Of course, gifs will be played at a loop. Then the simple social app navigation. This allows users to not only use the app for personal competition it can also be used as a social platform. The users can invite friends and families to have friendly mimic competitions instead of a super-serious data driving form correcting app. It lends itself to reusability because there is something to go back for, not just self-improvement. This allows for personas beyond athletes and health nuts like Jane the basketball fan to pick up and revisit the app to connect with similar-minded personas. The key point is to give a reason for users to come back to the app besides using the skeleton function, recent surveys have shown that users typically uninstall or do not use an app after a 24-hour period unless the app is extremely engaging or fulfills its job with minimum hassle.
